Currently just one: :func:`install_eager_task_factory`, an opt-in

public API surface stays small and the config dataclass
(:mod:`nidaqlib.config`) doesn't grow runtime side effects.

def install_eager_task_factory() -> bool:
    """Install :data:`asyncio.eager_task_factory` on the running event loop.

    Opt-in scheduling optimisation: skips one event-loop round-trip when a
    newly-created task's first ``await`` doesn't suspend — measurable under
    tight read/poll loops, zero cost otherwise.

    **Caveats.**

    - **asyncio-only.** trio uses a different scheduler; this function is a
      no-op there (returns ``False``) so the call site can run under either
      backend unconditionally.
    - **Loop-global.** Changes the running loop's task factory for *all*
      tasks created after the call, including user code outside this
      library. Enable once near app startup, not per-task.
    - **Semantic shift.** Eager tasks that return or raise before their
      first suspension point never hit the event loop, which can change
      ordering that observers depend on. Don't enable in code with
      subtle sequencing assumptions without testing both ways.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the factory was installed on an asyncio loop; ``False``
        if running on trio (detected via a missing ``set_task_factory``
        method) or outside any running loop.
